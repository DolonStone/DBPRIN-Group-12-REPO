Car Mechanic Shop Database (PostgreSQL)
This project is a relational database system built using PostgreSQL (psql) for managing the operations of a car mechanic shop. It was developed by a team of three students as part of a Database Principles university module, with a focus on sound relational design, data integrity, and practical querying.

The database models real-world workshop workflows such as customers, vehicles, repairs, parts, staff, and compliance tracking.
